<p>
    <a href="http://rust-lang.org" target="_blank">Rust</a> is a wonderful little in-development low-level programming language, designed for fun and awesome. It's still very young, and under some very rapid development, so at the time of writing it's a bit early to use for anything really serious, but once 1.0 is eventually released it's going to be fantastic.
</p>
<p>
    Rust's key aims are safety, concurrency, and speed. 
    <ul>
        <li>[It compiles to native code]</li>
        <li>[It allows for multiple methods of handling memory - on the stack and on various heaps, avoiding garbage collection for those who worry about GC pausing]</li>
        <li>[Actor pattern]</li>
        <li>[makes it very hard to get nulls (preferring wrapping results that might be empty in an Option), and [STUFF]]</li>
        <li></li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    In this series of tutorials, we're going to look at playing with Rust, alongside SDL, as everyone knows learning a language is more fun when you can make stuff explode on-screen.
</p>
<p>
    Our initial reference point is <a href="http://www.sdltutorials.com/sdl-tutorial-basics" target="_blank" title="SDL Tutorials">sdltutorials.com</a>'s tutorials, as it should ease us in nice and gently.
</p>
<h2>Getting the environment set up</h2>
<p>
    First things first, you're going to need to install Rust. At the moment, due to the fast rate of change in the language, you'll need the one in the <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust" target="_blank" title="Rust Source Code">Master branch on GitHub</a>. Clone it, and build it, following their instructions.
</p>
<p>
    Second, you'll need the Rust SDL libraries, and also SDL installed on your machine. Installing SDL is beyond the scope of this tutorial (check your package manager in Linux, if you're using it), but the Rust SDL package can be <a href="https://github.com/brson/rust-sdl" target="_blank" title="Rust SDL Source Code">downloaded also from GitHub</a>. To build it, simply navigate into the root and run Make. Check it worked by running Make Check. You should now have either a .so file, or a .dll, depending on your platform. That's the guy you're going to link against.
</p>
<p>
    Rust currently changes alot. If this code suddenly stops compiling, drop a note in the comments and I'll update it.
</p>
<h2>Writing some code</h2>
<p>First things first, let's stub out the minimum stuff we need to be able to check everything is compiling and happy. Make a folder for your project, and inside it, create the following directory structure</p>
<ul>
    <li>bin</li>
    <li>libs</li>
    <li>src</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Copy into <strong>libs</strong> your SO or DLL file. Make a new file called <strong>basics.rs</strong> - this is where we're going to put the code. Into this file, type the following -
</p>
<pre>
extern mod std;
extern mod sdl;

fn main() -> {
    io::println("Hello world!\n");
}
</pre>
<p>
    Once that's done, it's time to compile. On the command line, navigate to the root directory, and type the following.
</p>
<pre>
rustc -L libs -o bin/basics src/basics.rs
</pre>
<p>
    That should compile. After that, run the program that now lives in bin, and you should get a Hello world! Congratulations. Everything's set up for playing with SDL. You might want to stick that command into a script for ease of use.
</p>
<p>
    Before we continue, though, let's look at what we've actually done in the code.
</p>
<pre>
extern mod std;
extern mod stl;
</pre>
<p>
    So, this code is for linking against libraries. Here, we're pulling against std - which contains a lot of useful packages - and stl - the library we linked with -L.
</p>
<pre>
    fn main() -> {
        io::println("Hello world!\n");
    }
</pre>
<p>
    This is a function definition that returns nothing, much like any other C-family language you've worked with. <strong>io::println</strong> is going to call the println function that lives in the io module, which was linked against in std.
</p>
<p>
    So, let's get going. We're going to start with a near-empty struct with associated constructor. Add the following, underneath the extern links.
</p>
<pre>
struct Engine {
    mut running: bool,
    mut surface: *sdl::video::Surface
}

impl Engine {
    fn on_execute() {
    }
}

fn Engine() -> result::Result<Engine, ~str> {
    return result::Err("Not implemented");
}
</pre>
<p>
    And change Main to read as the following
</p> 
<pre>
fn main() {
    match Engine() {
        result::Ok(engine) => engine.on_execute(),
        result::Err(message) => {
            io::println(message);
        }
    };

}
</pre>
<p>
    So, what's going on here? Our constructor is using an idiom that's quite common in Rust, and in many functional languages. We're returning a Result type - which can either be what we're expecting wrapped in an Ok, or an error message wrapped in an Err if it fails - therefore, we don't have to risk playing with nulls. Most commonly, you'll see the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_type" title="Option type" target="_blank">Option type</a> in Rust, which returns either the item wrapped in 'Some', or a special value of None.</p>
<p>
    As we've not got as far as actually creating the engine, we're always returning a 'Not implemented' message. Now how do we deal with this weird type we're returning? Well, the best way is to us another of Rust's awesome features - pattern matching. Using the <strong>match</strong> keyword, when we call the constructing function, we then immediately pass it into something similar to the Switch statement of many C-like languages - except loads more powerful. We're actually checking for the shape of what's being matched, to get the engine out, or the string, straight from the Result. The compiler complains if the match isn't exhaustive, so you have to do something with the result, meaning less chances of missing an edge case.

<pre>
extern mod std;
extern mod sdl;

struct Engine {
    mut running: bool,
    mut surface: *sdl::video::Surface
}

impl Engine {
    fn on_execute() {

        while (self.running) {
            //Handle the event poll 
            let mut polling = true;
            while polling {
                sdl::event::poll_event(|event| {
                    match event {
                        sdl::event::QuitEvent => { self.running = false; }
                        sdl::event::NoEvent => { polling = false; }
                        _ => {}
                    }
                });
            }
            self.on_loop();
            self.on_render();
        }

        self.on_cleanup();
    }

    /*
     * Handles game logic, which is nothing at the moment
     */
    fn on_loop() {
    }

    /*
     * Handles rendering logic, which is also nothing!
     */
    fn on_render() {
    }

    /*
     * It's always good practice to release all the things we've aquired
     * before quitting out
     */
    fn on_cleanup() {
        sdl::video::free_surface(self.surface);
        sdl::quit();
    }
}

/*
 * Construct our Engine, and fill it with the surface we're going to need
 */
fn Engine() -> result::Result<Engine, ~str> {

    if sdl::init(~[sdl::InitVideo]) < 0 {
        return result::Err(#fmt("Unable to initialize SDL: %s", sdl::get_error()));
    }

    let surface = sdl::video::set_video_mode(640, 480, 31, ~[sdl::video::HWSurface], ~[sdl::video::DoubleBuf]);

    if surface == ptr::null() {
        return result::Err(#fmt("Unable to create surface: %s", sdl::get_error()));
    }

    return result::Ok(Engine {
        running: true,
        surface: surface
    });
}

fn main() {
    match Engine() {
        result::Ok(engine) => engine.on_execute(),
        result::Err(message) => {
            io::println(message);
        }
    };

}
</pre>
